                            I siguned up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.

          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programing step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a waythat no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
          often referred to it during interviws as an example of my development
          experience. It certanly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
          after receiving multiple offers. 100% recomended! "
